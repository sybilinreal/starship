# Starship
Starship is a program for Windows that reads the memory of GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- in order to generate an Activity (rich presence) for Discord.

![rich presence example](/.github/images/presence.png?raw=true)

# Usage
All you need to do is download the [latest version](https://github.com/sybilinreal/starship/releases/latest), and then run `starship.exe` and Strive at the same time.
The launch order does not matter â€” as long as Starship and Strive are running at the same time, it will (probably) work!
